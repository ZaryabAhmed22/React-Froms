>> GETING USER INPUT
- There are 2 ways of doing so.
1. useState
2. useRef
What to use useState or useRef
- When we have to validate once a form is submitted, we can use useRef
- When we have to validate the input on every ket stroke, useState can be used, useState ise also used if we want to reset the entered input
- reseting can be done with vanila JS, but directly manipulating the DOM is not a very clean way of using React.

>> VALIDATION
- The validation on the front-end is not enough, it's just to give user feedback.
- This code can be manipulated in the console
- The real validation is done on the server(backend)
