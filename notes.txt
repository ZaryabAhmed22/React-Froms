>> GETING USER INPUT
- There are 2 ways of doing so.
1. useState
2. useRef
What to use useState or useRef
- When we have to validate once a form is submitted, we can use useRef
- When we have to validate the input on every ket stroke, useState can be used, useState ise also used if we want to reset the entered input
- reseting can be done with vanila JS, but directly manipulating the DOM is not a very clean way of using React.

>> SIMPLE VALIDATION
- The validation on the front-end is not enough, it's just to give user feedback.
- This code can be manipulated in the console
- The real validation is done on the server(backend)

Step # 1
- Eliminate any empty data.

Step #2 
- Define state useState(), inputIsValid initally to true. 
- If the input is valid, set the state to true and if the state is invalid set the state to false

Step # 3
- Render the msg and styling conditionally

Draw back
- fisrt we were setting the initial state to true, which was infact not the ideal case because the untouched form would send an empty data which would cause problems in the server(if sent as an http request)
- To solve the problem we intoduced another state and first ensured that the form is touched or untouched.
